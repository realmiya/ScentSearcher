It has the highest profitability among British retailers. In terms of sales per square foot, Marks & Spencer stores in London make more profits than any other retail store in the world. Marks & Spencer also has the largest number of exports among UK retailers.
Marks & Spencer was originally a "one dollar convenience" store in 1884, but it didn''t develop into a chain retail store until 1915. In the decades since Marks & Spencer was founded, it has grown rapidly, and its chain stores have expanded to all parts of the world. In the 1990s, "relationship management" rose in the West. As an enterprise that has successfully used "relationship management", Marks & Spencer has become the focus of research.
Marks & Spencer owns its own brands such as "marks & Spencer" and many sub brands; At present, the group has more than 75000 employees, more than 600 stores in the UK and 275 branches in 40 regions around the world. Marks & Spencer opened its first department store on Nanjing West Road in Shanghai in the second half of 2008.
All the goods of Marks & Spencer are designed by Marks & Spencer itself or together with the manufacturer, and then the designed products are handed over to the manufacturer. The manufacturer strictly produces the products according to the specifications provided by Marks & Spencer to ensure the high and stable quality of the products. Marks & Spencer has a large number of technicians working closely with manufacturers to cooperate and supervise in material selection, technology, quality control and production process. Based on this concept, Marks & Spencer has surpassed the wholesaler link in the same industry, greatly reducing the cost. At the same time, the close cooperation with manufacturers, together with Marks & Spencer''s market research and product design, can meet the needs of consumers to the greatest extent, We have achieved the goal of "providing target customers with high-quality goods they can buy". This kind of service has realized the transformation from the traditional passive service to the active service. First of all, it breaks through the tradition of the department store retail industry, and its innovative business philosophy makes it unique in the department store chain industry.
Marks & Spencer takes "relationship management" as a systematic project, which aims at the long-term stable relationship between enterprises and customers, guarantees the cooperative relationship between enterprises and suppliers, and supports the good relationship between enterprises and employees, so as to create an atmosphere of cooperation and common development. It has long been accepted by the business community to attach importance to employees and customers, but the role of suppliers has been ignored for a long time, and some enterprises even think that they are the "God" of suppliers. Marks & Spencer, on the other hand, believes that companies should "work together" with suppliers.
The relationship with suppliers is based on good faith. Marks & Spencer''s case of helping Jiande reflects the sincerity of the company. Jiande used to be a bakery. After EDIF and her sister luff took over, they changed to producing blouses and became a supplier of Marks & Spencer. More than 30 years later, EDIF died, luff was also bedridden, and luff''s 16-year-old son was unable to support his family. Most companies are considering changing suppliers, but Marks & Spencer thinks it''s time to help her former co-operative partners and agrees to help her son deal with the business. Marks & Spencer first sent its own product manager to help manage it, and then took a loan of 120000 to participate in Jiande. With the sincere assistance of Marks & Spencer, Jiande has not only not closed down, but also become a multinational enterprise with 20 factories.',0);

The Yves leecher plant charter strictly stipulates the research contents and sources of raw materials, and never selects endangered plants and plants that have an impact on the future and the environment. Whenever possible, synthetic ingredients will be replaced by plant extracts. The product contains no ingredients from animals except honey and beeswax.

It was founded by Scotland doctor William Hunter (William Hunt) in Newport, Rhode Island in 1752, and is also one of the oldest perfume manufacturers. Its products include soap, perfume, washing liquid, shaving series, and other pharmaceutical care products, bath products and home fragrance products.
Initially, Caswell Massey was called "Dr. hunter''s Drugstore" to provide drug products for people as a drugstore. In 1755, Dr. hunter was the first doctor to teach anatomy and surgery to people in the colonial community. At the same time, he invented orange soda to help his patients take medicine more easily.
Rhode Island was a gathering area of social elites in the colonial period of the United States. They pursued European style elegant life. So Dr. hunt began to provide cosmetics, personal care products and health care services to his clients.
Hunter imported perfume from Europe and redeployed it himself. He numbered his own Cologne in Figures 1 to 20. The 6 perfume created in 1789 was the favorite of George Washington and John Adams. Oranges and citrus fragrances of No. 6 perfume attract generations of perfume lovers and are still being sold today.
In the beginning, Hunter''s drugstore manager was always passed from master to apprentice. William Hunter handed over the drugstore to his apprentice Charles feke, and then passed it on to Rowland hazard in 1822. After hazard became a drugstore partner, he changed the name of the drugstore to hazard & Caswell. In 1833, after the death of hazard, its name was changed to Caswell & hazard. In the same year, Caswell Massey opened its first branch in New York.
In 1840, Jockey Club perfume was listed. This perfume was once the favorite of President John Kennedy, and this perfume has also been sold so far.
Caswell Massey has won the trust of customers with its passion for quality and tireless pursuit of the best raw materials. Its clients range from founding fathers to pioneers on Wall Street, from movie stars to legendary artists. And its traditional technology has been passed down by generations of pharmacists.
Today, Caswell Massey continues its tradition of providing people with the best personal care products. Caswell Massey has three retail stores in the United States and is sold through the Internet and mail order catalog, as well as in department stores and specialty stores.',2);

Although the founder Paco rabane is Spanish, because the brand was founded in Paris, it is still a French brand. The Paco rabane brand currently belongs to the Puig group of Spain.
In the early 1960s, Paco rabane began to design clothes made of metal, plastic and other avant-garde materials. It also launched clothes made of paper, records, feathers, aluminum foil, leather, optical fiber, chocolate, plastic bottles, socks and door handles. On February 1, 1966, Paco rabane launched his first series and his 12 most classic experimental clothes in contemporary materials. He once said, "I don''t believe anyone can design unprecedented styles, such as hats, jackets and skirts, It''s impossible... The only fresh and avant-garde possibility of fashion design is the discovery of new materials I defy anyone to design a hat, coat or dress that hasn''t been done before...The only new frontier left in fashion is the finding of new materials"" - Paco Rabanne 1966)
Today, like many large fashion houses, the Paco Rabanne brand has been famous for a while, but today''s most famous perfume is its perfume. Some of the famous fragrances of the early Paco Rabanne have been discontinued, such as the 1985 Paco Rabanne La Nuit, and the Tenere in the name of the great desert of Africa in 1988.
Paco Rabanne reflects its architectural education background in the design of perfume bottles, so Paco Rabanne has the title of futuristic and futuristic at that time. To a certain extent, Paco rabane''s new fashion series projects the development of women, their goals, their expectations, the transformation of their lifestyle.
The million perfume (1 Million), which was launched by PA in 2008, was awarded the best bottle body, perfume and Media Award of France FIFI in 2009. In 2009, the best luxury perfume award and best bottle body award were FIFI. 1 Million men''s perfume is made by Christophe Raynaud, Oliver Pescheux and Michel Girar DQ. Labana, a Paco Rabanne, once said, "I love my fragrance when it first tastes fresh, and then brings out a sense of hierarchy and agitation and contrast." 1 Million men''s perfume is not a single flavor, but a multi-level feeling poured out, forming a deep original footprint. Paco Rabanne used the "strange and vibrant fragrance" to evaluate the luxurious member of the family of Labana.

It has the highest profitability among British retailers. In terms of sales per square foot, Marks & Spencer stores in London make more profits than any other retail store in the world. Marks & Spencer also has the largest number of exports among UK retailers.
Marks & Spencer was originally a "one dollar convenience" store in 1884, but it didn''t develop into a chain retail store until 1915. In the decades since Marks & Spencer was founded, it has grown rapidly, and its chain stores have expanded to all parts of the world. In the 1990s, "relationship management" rose in the West. As an enterprise that has successfully used "relationship management", Marks & Spencer has become the focus of research.
Marks & Spencer owns its own brands such as "marks & Spencer" and many sub brands; At present, the group has more than 75000 employees, more than 600 stores in the UK and 275 branches in 40 regions around the world. Marks & Spencer opened its first department store on Nanjing West Road in Shanghai in the second half of 2008.
All the goods of Marks & Spencer are designed by Marks & Spencer itself or together with the manufacturer, and then the designed products are handed over to the manufacturer. The manufacturer strictly produces the products according to the specifications provided by Marks & Spencer to ensure the high and stable quality of the products. Marks & Spencer has a large number of technicians working closely with manufacturers to cooperate and supervise in material selection, technology, quality control and production process. Based on this concept, Marks & Spencer has surpassed the wholesaler link in the same industry, greatly reducing the cost. At the same time, the close cooperation with manufacturers, together with Marks & Spencer''s market research and product design, can meet the needs of consumers to the greatest extent, We have achieved the goal of "providing target customers with high-quality goods they can buy". This kind of service has realized the transformation from the traditional passive service to the active service. First of all, it breaks through the tradition of the department store retail industry, and its innovative business philosophy makes it unique in the department store chain industry.
Marks & Spencer takes "relationship management" as a systematic project, which aims at the long-term stable relationship between enterprises and customers, guarantees the cooperative relationship between enterprises and suppliers, and supports the good relationship between enterprises and employees, so as to create an atmosphere of cooperation and common development. It has long been accepted by the business community to attach importance to employees and customers, but the role of suppliers has been ignored for a long time, and some enterprises even think that they are the "God" of suppliers. Marks & Spencer, on the other hand, believes that companies should "work together" with suppliers.
The relationship with suppliers is based on good faith. Marks & Spencer''s case of helping Jiande reflects the sincerity of the company. Jiande used to be a bakery. After EDIF and her sister luff took over, they changed to producing blouses and became a supplier of Marks & Spencer. More than 30 years later, EDIF died, luff was also bedridden, and luff''s 16-year-old son was unable to support his family. Most companies are considering changing suppliers, but Marks & Spencer thinks it''s time to help her former co-operative partners and agrees to help her son deal with the business. Marks & Spencer first sent its own product manager to help manage it, and then took a loan of 120000 to participate in Jiande. With the sincere assistance of Marks & Spencer, Jiande has not only not closed down, but also become a multinational enterprise with 20 factories.',0);

He liked to watch T-stage performances as much as his peers. Whenever he saw the colorful clothes, he dreamed of becoming the owner of such a company one day. On a sunny afternoon, he was in the garden, enjoying the sunshine while listening to the popular les copains program of French radio. All of a sudden, an idea came into his mind: "if the brand is named les copains, it''s very familiar to people. It sounds friendly and pleasant..." after months of intense preparation, his first fashion show proved that he was right. French fashion was recognized and respected by the world at that time. The French name les copains also caters to people''s pursuit of fashion psychology. With its Italian style, unique and highly personalized design, it is loved by French pop stars as soon as it appears on the stage, and becomes the object of their scramble to order, thus taking the first step of its success.

Some people call him Yves Saint Laurent of flowers, because he represents the most classic French creativity.
Christian tortu was born in a rural French peasant family. He had his own small garden since he was six years old, and he began to cultivate flowers when he was twelve years old. At that time, he began to practice flower arrangement, showing his outstanding ability in this field. No wonder people compare him to Mozart in the field of flowers, As a flower designer, he is also a very successful and smart businessman. From Paris to New York, and even in Singapore, they have florists under his name. Since he came to Paris in 1977, he has continued to study horticultural flowers and started to use his own technology in this field to design flowers for some brands, including Chanel and other famous brands. A few years later, when he was about to return to his country residence, he saw the words "for sale" hanging in front of a small flower shop in the Sixth District of Paris, so he bought the shop as his first one.
After that, the flower art of tortu was quickly appreciated by many celebrities in Paris, such as Catherine Deneuve, and soon began to design for various fashion shows, weddings, coffee shops and hotels. In 1998, he opened his second branch and expanded the product range to vases and tableware. After many years of success, he still adheres to his usual simple style. In his store, customers can see a slender vessel with a single flower in it, or a glass spherical transparent container suspended above, which is filled with soil, so that people can thoroughly see the appearance of roots shuttling through the soil, and so on. What Christian tortu wants to emphasize is that every flower is born with beauty and personality. They are born equal to human beings. If you look at them with your heart, you can see their most perfect side. Through the works that seem to be casual but actually attentive, you can re understand the true face of flowers that you think you know.
As a favorite of fashion and Life magazines, Christian tortu has a wide range of interests. He is also a new school painter. He likes to pay attention to people in all kinds of situations in modern urban life, because only in this way can he know how to make different people better appreciate the beauty of the flower world. He also studies fashion, home furnishings, music and other aspects of culture, because when you look at the landscape, the flowers in the garden are only a part, and the mixing is the real content of life, so his design will not be limited to the design of flowers, but will continue to extend this natural beauty to all aspects of life. Now Christian tortu is also a member of the florist school in Paris, where many Parisians and admirers from all over the world have come to listen to the lecture of this Florist design genius. He teaches them how to show the most beautiful side of a flower, but he doesn''t want them to be influenced by his style too much, because the concept is very important, everyone in the world can see different things, and the way they express their appreciation of a flower should be different.',2);

At the beginning of the creation, he invited the famous Paris perfume teacher Robert to make perfume for her. And the Oman businessman set up the Amouage love brand for the purpose of reviving the gap between China and Western Asia in the top perfume manufacturing industry with the reputation of perfume paradise. Ahmed was also promoted to the most national consciousness businessman by the perfume manufacturing industry. Of course, in spite of this, the development of the brand is also helpful to Paris''s romance and fashion. However, this kind of help is only a help, because it is believed that the Parisian can not produce perfume with 120 fragrance of perfume, which proves that the perfume of perfume really lives in the paradise of fragrance.
In the past 95 years, it is easy to see the brand name of the same brand of perfume, the love of women, in duty-free shops and luxury goods stores in various countries.
It is said that when Jesus was born, the three wise men of the east went to worship with gold, frankincense and myrrh. After the seventh century, Islam swept the Arabian peninsula south of the Holy Land Jerusalem, and frankincense and myrrh, which are equivalent to gold, are also loved by Muslims. Oman, which produces high-quality frankincense, was once a part of the powerful Arab Empire, occupying the position of sea and land incense road. The custom of widely using spices in religious rituals and daily life is still more traditional.
Since the Tang and Song dynasties in China, incense has become popular among court celebrities. Oman Frankincense, with Guangzhou as the import port, once amounted to one or two hundred tons a year. The ships carrying spices replaced Chinese silk and ceramics and returned to the Arabian Peninsula, forming a maritime spice road and Maritime Silk Road. Oman''s reputation as a spice Kingdom continues to this day.
At the beginning of 90, in order to revive the art of Arabia''s best frankincense and myrrh, Oman, the king of Sultan, hired a top international fragrance master, Gaye Robert Guy Robert, to create the best AMOUAGE representing the fragrance world of Arabia. Unlike the general perfume manufacturers who have budgetary restrictions on creation, the king of Sultan has given the fragrance masters unlimited play, and each love perfume contains 140 kinds of natural and precious spices. For example, wild lilies, rock roses, superior silver frankincense, myrrh, iris, jasmine, ambergris, cedar, sandalwood, musk, patchouli and oak moss in the valley.',0);

Its products include soap, perfume, washing liquid, shaving series, and other pharmaceutical care products, bath products and home fragrance products.
Initially, Caswell Massey was called "Dr. hunter''s Drugstore" to provide drug products for people as a drugstore. In 1755, Dr. hunter was the first doctor to teach anatomy and surgery to people in the colonial community. At the same time, he invented orange soda to help his patients take medicine more easily.
Rhode Island was a gathering area of social elites in the colonial period of the United States. They pursued European style elegant life. So Dr. hunt began to provide cosmetics, personal care products and health care services to his clients.
Hunter imported perfume from Europe and redeployed it himself. He numbered his own Cologne in Figures 1 to 20. The 6 perfume created in 1789 was the favorite of George Washington and John Adams. Oranges and citrus fragrances of No. 6 perfume attract generations of perfume lovers and are still being sold today.
In the beginning, Hunter''s drugstore manager was always passed from master to apprentice. William Hunter handed over the drugstore to his apprentice Charles feke, and then passed it on to Rowland hazard in 1822. After hazard became a drugstore partner, he changed the name of the drugstore to hazard & Caswell. In 1833, after the death of hazard, its name was changed to Caswell & hazard. In the same year, Caswell Massey opened its first branch in New York.
In 1840, Jockey Club perfume was listed. This perfume was once the favorite of President John Kennedy, and this perfume has also been sold so far.
Caswell Massey has won the trust of customers with its passion for quality and tireless pursuit of the best raw materials. Its clients range from founding fathers to pioneers on Wall Street, from movie stars to legendary artists. And its traditional technology has been passed down by generations of pharmacists.
Today, Caswell Massey continues its tradition of providing people with the best personal care products. Caswell Massey has three retail stores in the United States and is sold through the Internet and mail order catalog, as well as in department stores and specialty stores.',0);

It has the highest profitability among British retailers. In terms of sales per square foot, Marks & Spencer stores in London make more profits than any other retail store in the world. Marks & Spencer also has the largest number of exports among UK retailers.
Marks & Spencer was originally a "one dollar convenience" store in 1884, but it didn''t develop into a chain retail store until 1915. In the decades since Marks & Spencer was founded, it has grown rapidly, and its chain stores have expanded to all parts of the world. In the 1990s, "relationship management" rose in the West. As an enterprise that has successfully used "relationship management", Marks & Spencer has become the focus of research.
Marks & Spencer owns its own brands such as "marks & Spencer" and many sub brands; At present, the group has more than 75000 employees, more than 600 stores in the UK and 275 branches in 40 regions around the world. Marks & Spencer opened its first department store on Nanjing West Road in Shanghai in the second half of 2008.
All the goods of Marks & Spencer are designed by Marks & Spencer itself or together with the manufacturer, and then the designed products are handed over to the manufacturer. The manufacturer strictly produces the products according to the specifications provided by Marks & Spencer to ensure the high and stable quality of the products. Marks & Spencer has a large number of technicians working closely with manufacturers to cooperate and supervise in material selection, technology, quality control and production process. Based on this concept, Marks & Spencer has surpassed the wholesaler link in the same industry, greatly reducing the cost. At the same time, the close cooperation with manufacturers, together with Marks & Spencer''s market research and product design, can meet the needs of consumers to the greatest extent, We have achieved the goal of "providing target customers with high-quality goods they can buy". This kind of service has realized the transformation from the traditional passive service to the active service. First of all, it breaks through the tradition of the department store retail industry, and its innovative business philosophy makes it unique in the department store chain industry.
Marks & Spencer takes "relationship management" as a systematic project, which aims at the long-term stable relationship between enterprises and customers, guarantees the cooperative relationship between enterprises and suppliers, and supports the good relationship between enterprises and employees, so as to create an atmosphere of cooperation and common development. It has long been accepted by the business community to attach importance to employees and customers, but the role of suppliers has been ignored for a long time, and some enterprises even think that they are the "God" of suppliers. Marks & Spencer, on the other hand, believes that companies should "work together" with suppliers.
The relationship with suppliers is based on good faith. Marks & Spencer''s case of helping Jiande reflects the sincerity of the company. Jiande used to be a bakery. After EDIF and her sister luff took over, they changed to producing blouses and became a supplier of Marks & Spencer. More than 30 years later, EDIF died, luff was also bedridden, and luff''s 16-year-old son was unable to support his family. Most companies are considering changing suppliers, but Marks & Spencer thinks it''s time to help her former co-operative partners and agrees to help her son deal with the business. Marks & Spencer first sent its own product manager to help manage it, and then took a loan of 120000 to participate in Jiande. With the sincere assistance of Marks & Spencer, Jiande has not only not closed down, but also become a multinational enterprise with 20 factories.',0);

"I am a biologist and beekeeper. I love nature and beauty, and I am very interested in traditional wisdom and knowledge. So I founded melvita in 1983, because honey comes from flowers and is the result of the joint efforts of plants and animals.
In my eyes, the bee world has become the epitome of the increasingly fragile system of the earth due to the threat of industrial chemicals and parasites. If there were no bees in this world, there would be no flowers or fruits, and no beauty
Therefore, from the beginning, I listed "nature at heart" as the motto of the brand, expressing our concern for the environment and human beings.
Melvita is the pioneer of organic beauty. Today, we have become one of the leading brands of natural organic beauty products in France, because we firmly believe that adhering to the organic route is the key to maintaining the future ecological environment of the earth.
In addition to the efficacy of the product and the pleasant feeling when using it, I hope you can appreciate the pure and high-quality characteristics and business ethics behind the brand, and promote us to stand out in the industry today and be enthusiastic about organic products. "

After graduating from biology in 1977, he moved to aldesh.

At that time, the fragrance processing technology created by Houbigant has changed the traditional way of perfume modulation. It is no exaggeration to say that without Houbigant, there would be no modern perfume industry today.
Everything in the story comes from a basket of flowers. One day in 1775, in Paris, there was a man named Jean- ­ Francois Houbigant started his career by hanging a hand-painted basket full of flowers in front of a small shop in rue du faubourg Saint honor é. Fortunately, from the beginning, his fragrance products were loved by the royal family and nobles, and he had the opportunity to teach the ladies and ladies of Versailles how to spray incense on their fans to convey their tenderness. The famous story is that in 1793, Mary Antoinette, a French Tara, brought three bottles of Houbigant perfume to encourage her courage when she was sent to the scaffold.
Centuries later, Houbigant has gradually become the Royal perfume of European royalty. Josephine, who had not become queen of France at that time, belonged to a group of crazy young people who liked musk and were known as "the muscadins", and this muscadins made by Houbigant was Josephine''s favorite. Houbigant''s perfume also went to Europe with Napoleon. In 1815, Napoleon stayed in Paris for three months, which is called "100 day Dynasty" in history. In spite of the short time, Napoleon still did not forget to buy perfume when he went to Houbigant''s shop after the army was formed.
In 1829, Houbigant became the queen Luis Philip''s mother Adelaide d ''Orleans Princess Royal Highness''s perfume brand.
In 1838, Houbigant became the queen perfume perfume brand of Vitoria. In 1890, Czar Alexander III designated it for the exclusive use of the Russian royal family. Houbigant The perfume "The Czarina s Bouquet" was favored by Queen MariaFyodorovna. After her son tsarist Nicholas II succeeded in the throne, Houbigant was still designated as royalty. It can be seen from the ancient sales records of Houbigant that from the 1900 to the eve of the Russian Revolution in 1917, the Empress Dowager has been buying perfume for Houbigant, while her sister Yari Sandra, Queen Edward VII''s wife, began buying Houbigant incense water in 1902. Records show that two queen sisters also went to Houbigant during Christmas to buy perfume.
Let''s look at the list of famous people on the client list: the countess Saxon, Louis XVI''s cousin; The king and queen of the Netherlands; Princess of Italy; Napoleon''s sister, Princess Mathilde of batenberg; Duke moucy; Tolstoy; Russian ambassador; Maupassant; The Rothschild family and so on.
In 1880, perfume company Paul Parquet group intervened in Houbigant business. They moved their production and administration headquarters to Neuilly sur Seine near Paris, and expanded their production scale and set up a new laboratory. Rothschilds, the old tree, sprouts new shoots.
In 1882, Houbigant launched the first three new perfume Foug re Royale series, and created a new fragrance type fern fragrance, which has become a very important family in men''s perfume. The PaulParquet group, which took over the perfume business, did not move forward after success. They also developed updated artificial fragrances, such as Le Parfum Ideal perfume in 1900, Couer De Jeanette in 1908, and Parfum Inconnu in 1910, all of which are their masterpieces.
In 1912, Houbigant''s perfumer, Bienaim, regained control of the perfume business and made the famous Quelque Fleurs perfume. The perfume, which was full of complex fragrance, was an unprecedented success. After her success, she left the Houbigant in 1935 and started her own business. From the post Paul parquet period until 1950, Houbigant had two flavorers, Paul schving and Marcel billot, working for him. Marcel Billot also launched another famous perfume Chantilly in 1941.
At the same time, Houbigant expanded its business to the world. In addition to its headquarters in Paris, they also established branches in the United States, England, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Poland and even Romania. It has established ties with Havana, Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro, Australia, Japan and China.
From the very beginning, Mr. Michele Perris, who was deeply attracted by the perfume world, CO operated with some world-famous fragrances and cosmetics companies. When he met the descendants of the Houbigant family in 1973, he immediately stepped into Houbigant''s perfume career as a senior consultant. In the future cooperation, the two men established a great friendship. When Michele founded its own company in 1981, he got the right to distribute Houbigant perfume. Years later, Houbigant sold its brand ownership for health reasons, and the Perris family has been looking for the opportunity to recapture this brand of historic glory.

Miuccia (Mario Prada''s granddaughter) established a business partnership with Patrizio Bertelli, who had rich experience in luxury products at that time. With the change of fashion environment in the 1970s, prada was on the verge of bankruptcy. In 1978, Miuccia and her husband Patrizio Bertelli took over Prada and led Prada to a new milestone. As the chief designer of Prada, Miuccia continues to perform the legend of challenge and innovation through her talented fashion talent. Patrizio Bertelli, a creative entrepreneur, not only established Prada''s worldwide product distribution channels and mass production system, but also skillfully combined Prada''s traditional brand concept with modern advanced technology.
Prada entered the perfume industry in 2003, and made a series of Artisan Fragrances products, which are sold in only a few stores. Each perfume focuses on a single fragrance: iris, orange blossom, tuberosity, violet, and so on. And expanded this perfume series in 2007 and 2010. Currently, we have worked with Daniela (Roche) andrier, Carlos Benaim, Max gavarry, Clement gavarry and Miuccia Prada.',2);

Decleor, which means "having the golden key to the best" in French, has the same word with "aromatherapy plant care expert" today. 32 years ago, a doctor, a pharmacist, an aromatherapy therapist and a biochemist got together because of their common interests. When talking about the development trend of skin care products, they all focus on plant fragrance. As a result, the idea of creating an all natural beauty and skin care series was presented. These four practitioners immediately formed a research team to develop it. After long-term unremitting efforts, these experts finally found a shortcut to skin care: Aromatherapy + plant therapy. This unique skin care concept is mysterious and concise. The mystery lies in the fact that although aromatherapy is hidden in a small bottle, it contains natural magic power. Just a few drops at a time can help the skin absorb the follow-up skin care products three times. The cream of plant therapy contains many kinds of plant essence, which can provide nutrients, such as minerals, vitamins, water and other nutrients for the skin, and approach and protect your skin in a natural and gentle way. When it comes to simplicity, the best skin care effect can be achieved as long as it is used together with repair cream. It is so convenient to use that it naturally wins the reputation of simplicity.
Today, with 100% natural quality and highly effective therapeutic effect, Decleor has become a world recognized expert in aromatherapy. With thousands of distribution points in more than 60 countries around the world, it is recognized and respected by international beauty salons and beauticians.

But Mr. Enric Bernat found that the biggest problem of eating such candy is that the sugar is too big to eat in a short time, the children will get very dirty, and the parents do not support the children to eat sugar. So Mr. Enric Bernat had an idea. He thought why not add a stick. It''s convenient and interesting. Therefore, in 1958, the first Chupa Chups lollipop was produced. Because of its cool appearance and popular taste, it soon became the most famous person in Xiban.
In the 1970s, Mr. Enric Bernat invited the world-famous surrealist painter, Mr. Salvador Dali, to design the Pearl in order to make it more artistic and international. The logo with Daisy like appearance is now in use as a well-known classic image.
Chupa Chups soon occupied the domestic market of Spain and began to expand to the world in the 1970s, especially in Europe, Australia and the Asia Pacific region. Thanks to the continuous innovation and continuous improvement of products, Chupa Chups has become a popular lollipop brand all over the world. It has been sold in more than 100 countries around the world, with a market share of 28%, occupying an absolute leading position, creating a great era of lollipops.

Enric Bernat''s grandfather, Josep Bernat, was the first person to make candy in Spain. Chupa Chups, which was originally sold, were candy granules, which were very popular among children. But Mr. Enric Bernat found that the biggest problem of eating such candy is that the sugar is too big to eat in a short time, the children will get very dirty, and the parents do not support the children to eat sugar. So Mr. Enric Bernat had an idea. He thought why not add a stick. It''s convenient and interesting. Therefore, in 1958, the first Chupa Chups lollipop was produced. Because of its cool appearance and popular taste, it soon became the most famous person in Xiban.
In the 1970s, Mr. Enric Bernat invited the world-famous surrealist painter, Mr. Salvador Dali, to design the Pearl in order to make it more artistic and international. The logo with Daisy like appearance is now in use as a well-known classic image.
Chupa Chups soon occupied the domestic market of Spain and began to expand to the world in the 1970s, especially in Europe, Australia and the Asia Pacific region. Thanks to the continuous innovation and continuous improvement of products, Chupa Chups has become a popular lollipop brand all over the world. It has been sold in more than 100 countries around the world, with a market share of 28%, occupying an absolute leading position, creating a great era of lollipops.

At that time, the fragrance processing technology created by Houbigant has changed the traditional way of perfume modulation. It is no exaggeration to say that without Houbigant, there would be no modern perfume industry today.
Everything in the story comes from a basket of flowers. One day in 1775, in Paris, there was a man named Jean- ­ Francois Houbigant started his career by hanging a hand-painted basket full of flowers in front of a small shop in rue du faubourg Saint honor é. Fortunately, from the beginning, his fragrance products were loved by the royal family and nobles, and he had the opportunity to teach the ladies and ladies of Versailles how to spray incense on their fans to convey their tenderness. The famous story is that in 1793, Mary Antoinette, a French Tara, brought three bottles of Houbigant perfume to encourage her courage when she was sent to the scaffold.
Centuries later, Houbigant has gradually become the Royal perfume of European royalty. Josephine, who had not become queen of France at that time, belonged to a group of crazy young people who liked musk and were known as "the muscadins", and this muscadins made by Houbigant was Josephine''s favorite. Houbigant''s perfume also went to Europe with Napoleon. In 1815, Napoleon stayed in Paris for three months, which is called "100 day Dynasty" in history. In spite of the short time, Napoleon still did not forget to buy perfume when he went to Houbigant''s shop after the army was formed.
In 1829, Houbigant became the queen Luis Philip''s mother Adelaide d ''Orleans Princess Royal Highness''s perfume brand.
In 1838, Houbigant became the queen perfume perfume brand of Vitoria. In 1890, Czar Alexander III designated it for the exclusive use of the Russian royal family. Houbigant The perfume "The Czarina s Bouquet" was favored by Queen MariaFyodorovna. After her son tsarist Nicholas II succeeded in the throne, Houbigant was still designated as royalty. It can be seen from the ancient sales records of Houbigant that from the 1900 to the eve of the Russian Revolution in 1917, the Empress Dowager has been buying perfume for Houbigant, while her sister Yari Sandra, Queen Edward VII''s wife, began buying Houbigant incense water in 1902. Records show that two queen sisters also went to Houbigant during Christmas to buy perfume.
Let''s look at the list of famous people on the client list: the countess Saxon, Louis XVI''s cousin; The king and queen of the Netherlands; Princess of Italy; Napoleon''s sister, Princess Mathilde of batenberg; Duke moucy; Tolstoy; Russian ambassador; Maupassant; The Rothschild family and so on.
In 1880, perfume company Paul Parquet group intervened in Houbigant business. They moved their production and administration headquarters to Neuilly sur Seine near Paris, and expanded their production scale and set up a new laboratory. Rothschilds, the old tree, sprouts new shoots.
In 1882, Houbigant launched the first three new perfume Foug re Royale series, and created a new fragrance type fern fragrance, which has become a very important family in men''s perfume. The PaulParquet group, which took over the perfume business, did not move forward after success. They also developed updated artificial fragrances, such as Le Parfum Ideal perfume in 1900, Couer De Jeanette in 1908, and Parfum Inconnu in 1910, all of which are their masterpieces.
In 1912, Houbigant''s perfumer, Bienaim, regained control of the perfume business and made the famous Quelque Fleurs perfume. The perfume, which was full of complex fragrance, was an unprecedented success. After her success, she left the Houbigant in 1935 and started her own business. From the post Paul parquet period until 1950, Houbigant had two flavorers, Paul schving and Marcel billot, working for him. Marcel Billot also launched another famous perfume Chantilly in 1941.
At the same time, Houbigant expanded its business to the world. In addition to its headquarters in Paris, they also established branches in the United States, England, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Poland and even Romania. It has established ties with Havana, Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro, Australia, Japan and China.
From the very beginning, Mr. Michele Perris, who was deeply attracted by the perfume world, CO operated with some world-famous fragrances and cosmetics companies. When he met the descendants of the Houbigant family in 1973, he immediately stepped into Houbigant''s perfume career as a senior consultant. In the future cooperation, the two men established a great friendship. When Michele founded its own company in 1981, he got the right to distribute Houbigant perfume. Years later, Houbigant sold its brand ownership for health reasons, and the Perris family has been looking for the opportunity to recapture this brand of historic glory. After years of efforts, they finally acquired the ownership of Houbigant brand perfume and cosmetics in 2005. Since then, the Perris family has been fighting for the Houbigant brand to regain the respect and prestige it deserves.
Houbigant the first perfume was born in 1882, and the fragrance division includes Paul Parquet, Rodrigo Flores-Roux, Robert Bienaime and Houbigant.',0);

He is a real and far-reaching master; He represents the true Paris style, especially in the infinite elegance of the 1960s and 1970s. Designers of that era were often the old and young of high-end fashion, and they were endlessly obsessed with the classic elegant lines and meticulous workmanship. As for the hot deconstructionism and the trend of mix and match now, in the eyes of these designers, they are no different from heresy. Their fashion only has one purpose, how to make people more elegant and noble. Ted Lapidus, a veteran French designer, died of lung disease and leukemia at the age of 79 at a hospital in Cannes, France. Ted lapidis is an influential master. His haute couture represents the elegance of France. "He represents the elegance and classicism of France, making the fashion of men and women on the street accessible," French President Nicolas Sarkozy said Ted lapidis was born in 1929 in a tailor''s home in Paris. At the age of 22, he started his own brand. In 1963, he became a member of the Paris Fashion Association and started his career in haute couture. In the later decades of design, he once surprised the fashion world with modern style safari suit and Unisex, and even French superstar Brigitte Bardot was his loyal customer. In the 1960s and 1970s, it is no exaggeration to say that Ted lapidis swept the international fashion world. In a sense, he was "the poet of French high class women''s wear" at that time. In the early days, Ted Lapidis dominated the design of women''s wear. After the 80s of last century, he shifted the design emphasis to accessories and perfume, and released a series of watches and perfume. In 1982, his son Olivier Lapidus began to help him run the Ted Lapidus brand.',1);

He didn''t know what the birth of a girl named Rosita jelmani in a small Italian village 10 years later meant to him. The boy, nicknamed "Tai" by his friends, is brilliant, especially in sports. At the age of 16, he is the holder of the men''s record in the 400 meter race. Life didn''t mean plain sailing for him. Although World War II made him experience a series of hardships, it also made him strong and optimistic. Thanks to the 1948 London Olympic Games, Tai, as an athlete, met rosata, who was still a student. They were engaged in 1951 and married two years later. A small knitwear workshop was set up in the basement where they lived. In the same year, the couple founded the "Missoni" clothing brand and company in Italy, which is the origin of the famous "Missoni" Kingdom. It sounds like the story of the king and queen. Anyone who has seen Missoni''s works will be impressed by the complex and harmonious colors and patterns of his clothes. Many colors that seem to collide are put together. This seems contradictory, but it is reasonable in Thai''s hands. This designer with poet temperament controls the color like a magic cube. Even when his children and grandchildren were promoted to grandfathers, Tai was still intoxicated with playing with color cards and crayons in the studio to combine different series of dreamy colors. Sometimes he used machines to match colors, but most of them came from personal inspiration and mathematical logic. Different from Yves Saint Laurent''s famous "monterian style", Missoni''s color and geometric abstract patterns are like a kaleidoscope, with no repetition, only style: strip pattern, serrated pattern, slight fringes formed by the combination of flat needle and herringbone pattern Texture concave convex jacquard mosaic pattern... Whether it''s the hippie dominant 1970s or the minimalist 1990s, or even the days when it''s clamored to enter the post-modern era, color + stripe + knitting has always been the feature of Missoni design, and it''s also the best way to directly identify among many brands. This is reminiscent of Chanel''s famous saying: fashion changes, style lasts forever. In fact, in addition to wool knitting, more and more new fabrics such as linen, silk, cotton, tweed, corduroy and viscose fiber will be perfectly combined into pullovers, dresses, coats, sportswear, swimsuits and even tapestries and carpets by Missoni designers',0);

It sounds friendly and pleasant..." after months of intense preparation, his first fashion show proved that he was right. French fashion was recognized and respected by the world at that time. The French name les copains also caters to people''s pursuit of fashion psychology.

A space for one person in the perfume market, Rosa has written a Rochas''s endemic page for the world''s fashion. p> Marcel rochas, the founder of the rochas brand, is a landmark designer in the history of fashion. He invented a 2 / 3 length coat and was the first to sew a pocket on a skirt. In the fashion world, rochas once represented subversion, magnificence, and the incomparable dignity brought by its identity customization. The design of rochas is low-key and details oriented. Most of them are high-end hand sewn gowns with black and gray tone, emphasizing the gorgeous process of fabric and hand inlay. But with the death of Marcel Rochas, Rochas declined, leaving only the same perfume. "Mareal" p> In 2003, P & G Group acquired the mismanaged rochas, injected a lot of money, and invited the young Belgian talented designer Olivier thyskens to revive this noble brand in just two years. The authoritative women''s wear daily ranked it as one of the "top ten brands" for several consecutive fashion seasons, Rochas also quickly become the brand of choice for female stars on the red carpet< P>, but Rosa''s (Rochas) perfumes seem to be much more profitable than P&G, which is much less popular than fashion. Olivier Theyskens, a self respecting designer, would rather work hard to sew exquisite and expensive dresses by hand than find a business partner to sell them to. So in 2006, P&G broke the friendly veil and ended the unprofitable Rochas fashion business, leaving only the perfume business. p> In 2009, Marco Zanini, an Italian designer, became the new designer of rochas. Marco Zanini was the chief designer of Versace''s women''s and haute couture collections and the creative director of Halston. Marco Zanini launched his first women''s collection for rochas at Paris Fashion Week in autumn and winter 2009< p>',0);

It has the highest profitability among British retailers. In terms of sales per square foot, Marks & Spencer stores in London make more profits than any other retail store in the world. Marks & Spencer also has the largest number of exports among UK retailers.
Marks & Spencer was originally a "one dollar convenience" store in 1884, but it didn''t develop into a chain retail store until 1915. In the decades since Marks & Spencer was founded, it has grown rapidly, and its chain stores have expanded to all parts of the world. In the 1990s, "relationship management" rose in the West. As an enterprise that has successfully used "relationship management", Marks & Spencer has become the focus of research.
Marks & Spencer owns its own brands such as "marks & Spencer" and many sub brands; At present, the group has more than 75000 employees, more than 600 stores in the UK and 275 branches in 40 regions around the world. Marks & Spencer opened its first department store on Nanjing West Road in Shanghai in the second half of 2008.
All the goods of Marks & Spencer are designed by Marks & Spencer itself or together with the manufacturer, and then the designed products are handed over to the manufacturer. The manufacturer strictly produces the products according to the specifications provided by Marks & Spencer to ensure the high and stable quality of the products. Marks & Spencer has a large number of technicians working closely with manufacturers to cooperate and supervise in material selection, technology, quality control and production process. Based on this concept, Marks & Spencer has surpassed the wholesaler link in the same industry, greatly reducing the cost. At the same time, the close cooperation with manufacturers, together with Marks & Spencer''s market research and product design, can meet the needs of consumers to the greatest extent, We have achieved the goal of "providing target customers with high-quality goods they can buy". This kind of service has realized the transformation from the traditional passive service to the active service. First of all, it breaks through the tradition of the department store retail industry, and its innovative business philosophy makes it unique in the department store chain industry.
Marks & Spencer takes "relationship management" as a systematic project, which aims at the long-term stable relationship between enterprises and customers, guarantees the cooperative relationship between enterprises and suppliers, and supports the good relationship between enterprises and employees, so as to create an atmosphere of cooperation and common development. It has long been accepted by the business community to attach importance to employees and customers, but the role of suppliers has been ignored for a long time, and some enterprises even think that they are the "God" of suppliers. Marks & Spencer, on the other hand, believes that companies should "work together" with suppliers.
The relationship with suppliers is based on good faith. Marks & Spencer''s case of helping Jiande reflects the sincerity of the company. Jiande used to be a bakery. After EDIF and her sister luff took over, they changed to producing blouses and became a supplier of Marks & Spencer. More than 30 years later, EDIF died, luff was also bedridden, and luff''s 16-year-old son was unable to support his family. Most companies are considering changing suppliers, but Marks & Spencer thinks it''s time to help her former co-operative partners and agrees to help her son deal with the business. Marks & Spencer first sent its own product manager to help manage it, and then took a loan of 120000 to participate in Jiande. With the sincere assistance of Marks & Spencer, Jiande has not only not closed down, but also become a multinational enterprise with 20 factories.',0);

It is a world-famous cosmetics brand with a long history. Since its inception, it has won the favor of a large number of women with its fresh packaging and candy like charming color. It is one of the few time-honored brands still popular in Paris.
Mr. Alexandre Napoleon bourjous, the founder of Marvel Paris, is a loyal stage drama enthusiast. In his communication with stage drama actresses, he often heard them complain that the cosmetics at that time were too greasy, uncomfortable and hurt their skin, and they were worried that they could not find suitable color makeup products. So Alexandre Napoleon Bourjois, after a long time of research and exploration, changed the popular Rouge paste to Powder Blush, and invented the first blush brush in the world, which became a breakthrough in the makeup industry at that time. BOURJOIS also improved the stage make-up products at that time, creating a series of color products that are easier to color and more comfortable, so that women can enjoy the fun of make-up. As a result, Mr. Alexandre Napoleon BOURJOIS founded the BOURJOIS brand.
Since then, BOURJOIS''s clever ideas have been spread around the world with its make-up products by actresses.
Bourjous and Chanel come from the same factory and are Chanel''s open shelf brands. In the manufacture of cosmetics, bourjous retains the most traditional baking method, because it can make the rouge powder more delicate and smooth. So far, Paris''s more than 90 year old blush is still the most popular star product, and is popular among fans all over the world.
Recently, I believe that MM who love to read Japanese magazines will often see BOURJOIS in magazines, because in Japan, which leads the trend of Asian fashion, BOURJOIS fans have a rapid growth after entering the market, and become one of the hottest cosmetics brands.
Now, bourjous has come to China, hoping to bring more Chinese women better cosmetics products and experience.',1);

His romantic and gorgeous creative style is full of the decorative sense of the Eastern European church, but he does not lose his elegant and graceful noble temperament. The taste style of Romeo Gigli is worthy of careful taste.
The model in Romeo Gigli, with pale make-up, looks noble and light, walking barefoot on the T-shaped stage in gorgeous clothes, just like King Arthur''s Guinevere or Klimt''s meditative girl. Gigli didn''t come from the streets. The club and MTV are very proud of him. His mother was a countess, his father was an antique book collector, and Gigli spent his childhood alone in a villa in Italy in the 16th century. Isolated from the library of more than 20000 books, Gigli''s design originated from Byzantine, Renaissance Venice and pre Raphael England. The protagonist of his 1989 / 90 autumn and winter series is Theodora, a 6th Century Oriental queen. He is known as Paul poiret and the new fortune
Gigli started as an architect, but when his parents died at the age of 19, he gave up. He spent the next ten years traveling in the East. He has been to Morocco, China and India. In 1979, his trip ended in England. There, he met the designer Dmitri and worked with him since. In 1988, he returned to Italy and opened his own store in Milan: Corso Como.
The core of Gigli''s design is the use of precious fabrics: velvets of Sprite, lace of gem clusters, and silk of flame. His series are generally long and smooth, never shabby. Slim cigarette pants get thinner and thinner at the knee, with a high waist, soft oval jacket or a bra decorated with bead curtains. Often, his outline is a little elegant. It can be said that the origin of his design comes from two important parts in his life: ten thousand volumes of books and ten thousand miles of road. Therefore, in his design, we feel strongly the love of our country and foreign people all the time.
His first Paris design was praised by Suzy Menkes, which was on the front page of "the International Herald Tribune" and the cover of "women''s Wear Daily". He won the Woolmark award in 1990.
Gigli first showed off his men''s wear in 1989, and in 1990, he launched the second tier: G. Gigli.

It is a world-famous cosmetics brand with a long history. Since its inception, it has won the favor of a large number of women with its fresh packaging and candy like charming color. It is one of the few time-honored brands still popular in Paris.
Mr. Alexandre Napoleon bourjous, the founder of Marvel Paris, is a loyal stage drama enthusiast. In his communication with stage drama actresses, he often heard them complain that the cosmetics at that time were too greasy, uncomfortable and hurt their skin, and they were worried that they could not find suitable color makeup products. So Alexandre Napoleon Bourjois, after a long time of research and exploration, changed the popular Rouge paste to Powder Blush, and invented the first blush brush in the world, which became a breakthrough in the makeup industry at that time. BOURJOIS also improved the stage make-up products at that time, creating a series of color products that are easier to color and more comfortable, so that women can enjoy the fun of make-up. As a result, Mr. Alexandre Napoleon BOURJOIS founded the BOURJOIS brand.
Since then, BOURJOIS''s clever ideas have been spread around the world with its make-up products by actresses.
Bourjous and Chanel come from the same factory and are Chanel''s open shelf brands. In the manufacture of cosmetics, bourjous retains the most traditional baking method, because it can make the rouge powder more delicate and smooth. So far, Paris''s more than 90 year old blush is still the most popular star product, and is popular among fans all over the world.
Recently, I believe that MM who love to read Japanese magazines will often see BOURJOIS in magazines, because in Japan, which leads the trend of Asian fashion, BOURJOIS fans have a rapid growth after entering the market, and become one of the hottest cosmetics brands.
Now, bourjous has come to China, hoping to bring more Chinese women better cosmetics products and experience.',1);

After more than half a century of fashion, rochas created numerous fashion topics. This simple, beautiful and high-quality brand model has been the preferred brand for celebrities to attend important occasions. A space for one person in the perfume market, Rosa has also written a rotten title page for the world''s fashion. Rochas
Marcel rochas, the founder of the rochas brand, is a landmark designer in the history of fashion. He invented a 2 / 3 length coat and was the first to sew a pocket on a skirt. In the fashion world, rochas once represented subversion, magnificence, and the incomparable dignity brought by its identity customization. The design of rochas is low-key and details oriented. Most of them are high-end hand sewn gowns with black and gray tone, emphasizing the gorgeous process of fabric and hand inlay. But with the death of Marcel Rochas, Rochas gradually declined, leaving only the same perfume. Mareal.
In 2003, P & G Group acquired the mismanaged rochas, injected a lot of money and invited Olivier thyskens, a talented young Belgian designer, to revive this noble brand in just two years. The authoritative women''s Wear Daily has rated it as one of the "top ten brands" for several consecutive fashion seasons, Rochas also quickly become the brand of choice for female stars on the red carpet.
But the benefits of Rosa''s perfume seem to be much more pleasing to investors than P&G, a popular fashion. Olivier Theyskens, a self respecting designer, would rather work hard to sew exquisite and expensive dresses by hand than find a business partner to sell them to. So in 2006, P&G broke the friendly veil and ended the unprofitable Rochas fashion business, leaving only the perfume business.
In 2009, Marco Zanini, an Italian designer, became the new designer of rochas. Marco Zanini was the chief designer of Versace''s women''s and haute couture collections and the creative director of Halston. Marco Zanini launched his first women''s collection for rochas at Paris Fashion Week in autumn and winter 2009.',0);

In his communication with stage drama actresses, he often heard them complain that the cosmetics at that time were too greasy, uncomfortable and hurt their skin, and they were worried that they could not find suitable color makeup products. So Alexandre Napoleon Bourjois, after a long time of research and exploration, changed the popular Rouge paste to Powder Blush, and invented the first blush brush in the world, which became a breakthrough in the makeup industry at that time. BOURJOIS also improved the stage make-up products at that time, creating a series of color products that are easier to color and more comfortable, so that women can enjoy the fun of make-up. As a result, Mr. Alexandre Napoleon BOURJOIS founded the BOURJOIS brand< p> Since then, BOURJOIS''s clever ideas have been spread around the world with its make-up products by actresses< p> Bourjous and Chanel come from the same factory and are Chanel''s open shelf brands.

It can be said that Marni is a famous brand in the international fashion industry. Marni women''s wear, with a "relaxed and pleasant" style, perfectly combines the early hippie style with the modern sense, boldly collides with the color block and boldly uses the accessories, which quickly captured the hearts of women all over the world.
Marni was founded in 1994. The brand name of Marni comes from the designer''s sister''s name "Marni". The brand of Marni is co founded by CONSUELO Castiglioni and her husband Gianni Castiglioni. CONSUELO Castiglioni has always been the designer of Marni, Husband Gianni Castiglioni is the CEO and chairman of Marni brand. Their daughter, Carolina Castiglioni, founded Marni''s online store in 2006 and is responsible for its operation and management.
Since its establishment in 1994, with the continuous development and growth of Marni brand, today''s Marni show has become one of the biggest attractions in Milan fashion week twice a year, and its products have also expanded from women''s wear to a rich series including men''s wear, bags, jewelry and glasses. Her talent is not only reflected in the selection of colors, tailoring and fabrics, but also in her constant search for and application of innovative technologies in the design of Marni. With the most perfect, simple and comfortable fashion silhouette, she presents the praiseworthy women''s wear series season after season.
Since its launch in 1994, Marni''s design style has been obviously "mix and match" - even in the era when women were just getting rid of suits. The exotic style from North Africa, the nostalgic Hippie flavor of the 1970s, together with the fresh urban modern flavor, make the unique "eclecticism" design of Marni. In addition, another design principle that Marni insists on is to make "women feel completely comfortable and free when they are in fashion". For this reason, Marni even gave up the fashionable tight silhouette which was not satisfied with comfort. Marni has turned away from the design of body folds or extremely impractical body tassels, which are common in fashion brands. It is also because of adhering to the concept of "comfort", Marni is trying to develop another direction of women''s wear - oversize or trapezoidal dress.
Marni''s bold attempts in color, print and silhouette let women really make choices for themselves without catering to men''s "sexy" preference. J. Jenna Lyons, senior vice president of women''s wear Department of crew, once praised the design of Marni, saying: "Marni started the post Tom Ford era."（ post-Tom Ford era)
Marni is very proud of its pure Italian blood. It is not only produced in Italy, but also has no authorization to operate. The brand is controlled by family members.',0);

On February 12 of the same year, she agreed to go naked as a photography model at a photography teaching course offered by photographer Martin Schreiber for $30, and then signed an agreement to renounce all rights.
I didn''t expect that Madonna would be popular in music soon, and this group of nude photos also appreciated greatly. In 1985, Martin Schreiber sold four of them to playboy. Later, Martin Schreiber also published a book called Madonna nudes 1979, which included the photos taken at that time. Madonna could not say that she had suffered.
Later, beauty contact bought the trademark rights of Madonna nudes 1979, making it a famous brand.
Madonna Nudes 1979 brand was born shortly after the launch of perfume products in 2010. The co operative fragrance technicians include Marc Blaison, Constance Georges-Picot and Arnaud Winter.',0);

He didn''t know what the birth of a girl named Rosita jelmani in a small Italian village 10 years later meant to him. The boy, nicknamed "Tai" by his friends, is brilliant, especially in sports. At the age of 16, he is the holder of the men''s record in the 400 meter race. Life didn''t mean plain sailing for him. Although World War II made him experience a series of hardships, it also made him strong and optimistic. Thanks to the 1948 London Olympic Games, Tai, as an athlete, met rosata, who was still a student. They were engaged in 1951 and married two years later. A small knitwear workshop was set up in the basement where they lived. In the same year, the couple founded the "Missoni" clothing brand and company in Italy, which is the origin of the famous "Missoni" Kingdom. It sounds like the story of the king and queen. Anyone who has seen Missoni''s works will be impressed by the complex and harmonious colors and patterns of his clothes. Many colors that seem to collide are put together. This seems contradictory, but it is reasonable in Thai''s hands. This designer with poet temperament controls the color like a magic cube. Even when his children and grandchildren were promoted to grandfathers, Tai was still intoxicated with playing with color cards and crayons in the studio to combine different series of dreamy colors. Sometimes he used machines to match colors, but most of them came from personal inspiration and mathematical logic. Different from Yves Saint Laurent''s famous "monterian style", Missoni''s color and geometric abstract patterns are like a kaleidoscope, with no repetition, only style: strip pattern, serrated pattern, slight fringes formed by the combination of flat needle and herringbone pattern Texture concave convex jacquard mosaic pattern... Whether it''s the hippie dominant 1970s or the minimalist 1990s, or even the days when it''s clamored to enter the post-modern era, color + stripe + knitting has always been the feature of Missoni design, and it''s also the best way to directly identify among many brands. This is reminiscent of Chanel''s famous saying: fashion changes, style lasts forever. In fact, in addition to wool knitting, more and more new fabrics such as linen, silk, cotton, tweed, corduroy and viscose fiber will be perfectly combined into pullovers, dresses, coats, sportswear, swimsuits and even tapestries and carpets by Missoni designers',1);

He didn''t know what the birth of a girl named Rosita jelmani in a small Italian village 10 years later meant to him. The boy, nicknamed "Tai" by his friends, is brilliant, especially in sports. At the age of 16, he is the holder of the men''s record in the 400 meter race. Life didn''t mean plain sailing for him. Although World War II made him experience a series of hardships, it also made him strong and optimistic. Thanks to the 1948 London Olympic Games, Tai, as an athlete, met rosata, who was still a student. They were engaged in 1951 and married two years later. A small knitwear workshop was set up in the basement where they lived. In the same year, the couple founded the "Missoni" clothing brand and company in Italy, which is the origin of the famous "Missoni" Kingdom. It sounds like the story of the king and queen. Anyone who has seen Missoni''s works will be impressed by the complex and harmonious colors and patterns of his clothes. Many colors that seem to collide are put together. This seems contradictory, but it is reasonable in Thai''s hands. This designer with poet temperament controls the color like a magic cube. Even when his children and grandchildren were promoted to grandfathers, Tai was still intoxicated with playing with color cards and crayons in the studio to combine different series of dreamy colors. Sometimes he used machines to match colors, but most of them came from personal inspiration and mathematical logic. Different from Yves Saint Laurent''s famous "monterian style", Missoni''s color and geometric abstract patterns are like a kaleidoscope, with no repetition, only style: strip pattern, serrated pattern, slight fringes formed by the combination of flat needle and herringbone pattern Texture concave convex jacquard mosaic pattern...

He studied chemistry and law in his early years. 1971-1972 in London, free jewelry designer. In 1973, he returned to Paris and worked as a clothing and accessories designer in etiel Jue ideal cuir company. Later, he worked as a design assistant in macdouglas leather company. He was promoted to chief designer in 1974. From 1975 to 1978, he was a freelance designer. Since 1979, he has set up a personal brand company and worked as a designer. From 1989 to 1992, she was a senior women''s designer of Lanvin company. Women''s wear was introduced in 1979. Men''s wear was launched in 1981 and perfume Montana Pour Femme was launched in 1986. Perfume Parfum d''Homme was launched in 1989. Perfume Parfum d''Elle was launched in 1990. In 1991, the lower price clothing series was launched. Fur accessories series were launched in 1996. Montana Blu was launched in 1998. Perfume Montana Blu was launched in 1998. p> Style review: few clothes are as weird and aggressive as Montana''s silhouette, and few designers are as controversial as he is. As early as 1979, Claude Montana was regarded as a traitor by many people and thought that he was likely to be short-lived. Most of his clothes use shoulder pads, and leather appears frequently. Supporters say this style makes people look very capable and has the charm of Valencia. Opponents call it the cartoon female image in the eyes of people who hate women. Montana''s clothing is deeply influenced by architectural art. The top is a heavy geometric figure with a pencil like skirt or trousers, which is very abrupt in transition. This kind of profile is very rare before Montana. The shoulders and collars of this brand of clothing are often exaggerated. Combined with the slim waist, the smooth lines are close to the human body or flowing away, which is very similar to the rotation in the dance, giving people a pleasant feeling. From the perspective of structure, Montana''s clothing cutting is extremely accurate. The form is simple, but it contains strong female charm. In fabric, Montana''s use of leather is unprecedented. As early as the 1980s, men''s leather jacket was introduced into women''s clothing, which caused different opinions. The critics called it "the hobby of neutral people", "hatred of women", "cumbersome decoration" and "impractical". Ten years later, Calvin Klein, Donna Cullen and Ralph Lauren have launched similar works. Facts have finally proved that what was regarded as extreme in the past will be gradually accepted later, which has become the law of development in the history of fashion. Montana balances abstract art form with realistic clothing. His aesthetic concept is based on spiral and straight line. Some criticized it as "too much Futurism and space age style", while others praised it as "progress in the abstract principles of futurism". It is undeniable that the unique form of Montana clothing has a lasting influence on the modern fashion industry, which has already surpassed the so-called "avant-garde art". From the 1980s to the 1990s, Montana''s clothing has also changed, which is reflected in the flattening of the raised shoulders, leaving only the exaggerated collar to convey the upward message. Montana is constantly practicing and exploring the unique cutting method of fashion. His persistent pursuit and unique design style are called "bad children" by people in the cultural circle, but at the same time, Montana brand occupies a place in the world famous brand palace< p><p>',0);

It is one of the few time-honored brands still popular in Paris< p> Mr. Alexandre Napoleon bourjous, the founder of Marvel Paris, is a loyal stage drama enthusiast. In his communication with stage drama actresses, he often heard them complain that the cosmetics at that time were too greasy, uncomfortable and hurt their skin, and they were worried that they could not find suitable color makeup products. So Alexandre Napoleon Bourjois, after a long time of research and exploration, changed the popular Rouge paste to Powder Blush, and invented the first blush brush in the world, which became a breakthrough in the makeup industry at that time. BOURJOIS also improved the stage make-up products at that time, creating a series of color products that are easier to color and more comfortable, so that women can enjoy the fun of make-up. As a result, Mr. Alexandre Napoleon BOURJOIS founded the BOURJOIS brand< p> Since then, BOURJOIS''s clever ideas have been spread around the world with its make-up products by actresses< p> Bourjous and Chanel come from the same factory and are Chanel''s open shelf brands. In the manufacture of cosmetics, bourjous retains the most traditional baking method, because it can make the rouge powder more delicate and smooth. So far, Paris''s more than 90 year old blush is still the most popular star product, and is popular among fans all over the world. p> Recently, I believe that MM who love to read Japanese magazines will often see BOURJOIS in magazines, because in Japan, which leads the trend of Asian fashion, BOURJOIS fans have a rapid growth after entering the market, and become one of the hottest cosmetics brands< p> Now, bourjous has come to China, hoping to bring more Chinese women better cosmetics products and experience.',0);

It was founded by Louis Fran à OIS Cartier at Rue montorgueil 31 in Paris in 1847. In 1874, his son Alfa Cartier inherited his management power, and his grandsons Louis Cartier, Pierre Cartier and JIS Cartier developed it into a world-famous brand. It is a subsidiary of Compagnie financi è re Richemont SA. In 1904, he designed the world''s first wrist watch, Cartier Santos, for aviator Alberto Santos Dumen.
Women all over the world dream of getting something designed by Cartier. For more than 100 years, as the most famous jeweler in the world, Cartier has become the synonym of nobility, rarity and incomparable beauty.
Cartire, which has a long history of over 160 years, has been making exquisite perfume perfumed bottles for the dignitary Royal since the late nineteenth Century. This has opened the legend of Cartire perfume. Cartire launched two innovative fragrances in 1981. For women, it is designed to be "self conceited". It is a perfume full of temptation and sexy and Oriental color, which is designed in the perfume bottle inspired by the oval lighter. It is also a far-reaching perfume, because it presents a new concept of perfume, that is, as night style perfume, its fragrance can be covered on the daily use, and complement each other. Cartire''s other perfume is designed for men, "men''s sports fragrance" to commemorate the Brazil pilot Santos Du Meng.
Cartire perfume is divided into ladies, men and neutral perfume. Its inspiration is derived from Cartire''s most beautiful jewelry works and the most representative theme design. Cartire men''s perfume, Roadster perfume, the design idea of Roadster watch is the dominant idea established by the designer in the process of space works. It endows the works with cultural connotation and style characteristics. Good design concept is very important, it is not only the essence of design, but also can make the work personalized, professional and different. Full of free and unrestrained soul. Created by Mathilde Laurent, the Cartier fragrance master, the ice cream is permeated with the vitality of British mint, and the charm of patchouli, rock rose and vanilla are combined to form a sensual and romantic flavor, and then exude the fragrance of Kashmir wood. The creative inspiration of the fragrance bottle is triggered by the magnificent case of roadster watch and the charming semi-circular gem crown, which sets a strong tone for the design of the fragrance bottle and perfectly matches with the smooth and magnificent lines, presenting the extraordinary temperament of bold simplicity and noble taste.

The first mentioned that this brand is famous for its use of many rare ingredients in perfume. As for the raw materials used in perfume, the mainstream is the European (flower, spice, fruit) system, probably because the fragrances are basically European and American people, so the raw materials used can not be separated from that cultural range. For example, lavender, vetiver, vanilla, raspberry, pink pepper, bergamot and rosemary are not familiar to Chinese people; China''s common osmanthus flowers, such as lotus anise, are not common in perfume.',2);

Isolated from the library of more than 20000 books, Gigli''s design originated from Byzantine, Renaissance Venice and pre Raphael England. The protagonist of his 1989 / 90 autumn and winter series is Theodora, a 6th Century Oriental queen. He is known as Paul poiret and the new fortune
Gigli started as an architect, but when his parents died at the age of 19, he gave up. He spent the next ten years traveling in the East. He has been to Morocco, China and India. In 1979, his trip ended in England. There, he met the designer Dmitri and worked with him since. In 1988, he returned to Italy and opened his own store in Milan: Corso Como.
The core of Gigli''s design is the use of precious fabrics: velvets of Sprite, lace of gem clusters, and silk of flame. His series are generally long and smooth, never shabby. Slim cigarette pants get thinner and thinner at the knee, with a high waist, soft oval jacket or a bra decorated with bead curtains. Often, his outline is a little elegant. It can be said that the origin of his design comes from two important parts in his life: ten thousand volumes of books and ten thousand miles of road. Therefore, in his design, we feel strongly the love of our country and foreign people all the time.
His first Paris design was praised by Suzy Menkes, which was on the front page of "the International Herald Tribune" and the cover of "women''s Wear Daily". He won the Woolmark award in 1990.
Gigli first showed off his men''s wear in 1989, and in 1990, he launched the second tier: G. Gigli.
With a keen sense of art, Romeo Gigli presents a unique world of gentlemen. Gigli, who is challenging a whole new field, has attracted attention from all walks of life. His elegant design of English style has created a designer image for him. With Europe and the Renaissance as the creative idea, it brought a series of retro trends.',0);

Lothair once carried a large number of tea and exotic treasures to and from all over the world, which can be described as the legend of the sea at the end of the 19th century.
Lothair EDP fragrance is created by Bertrand duchaufour, a master of fragrance making. It describes Lothair, a sailing ship in history, with its natural and graceful posture on the sea. Ride the wind and waves in the sea, and the breath of salt and salt, as if the link between the sea and the sky, reveals the determination of the helmsman to sail the wind and break the waves. In the middle of the figs, the leaves are green and sweet and the soft flowers of Magnolia are mixed with amber and woody. It is like a sail passing through the night, and through the wet deck, the peculiar fragrance comes from the cabin full of wooden boxes.',1);

Cashmere coats with bright colors launched in 1992 include cherry red, orange, chrome yellow, mint green and other colors, as well as early evening dresses with purplish red, cobalt blue and other color linings. Jasper Conran''s silk suits have also been designed in ice blue, bright red, cocoa and fruit colors. In 1988, Jasper Conran launched the men''s wear series, which still continues the classic tailoring style of women''s wear. Black and white pinstriped cotton top with high buckle waistcoat and tapered pants depicts a typical British fashion picture. In spring and summer of 2001, white double breasted suits, sleeveless pleated shirts, and swimsuits made of striped cloth and towel cloth.
Jasper Conran in recent seasons can see that he emphasizes the brand''s self personality more, women''s clothing is more romantic, while men''s clothing is slightly masculine with boxing''s free fighting style besides the classic cut''s Retro elegance.
Jasper Conran''s success is due to his extraordinary grasp of color and style, as well as his strong commercial awareness of the international operation of the brand, which also includes designing clothes for the princess of Wales.',0);
